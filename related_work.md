Towards Planning in Generalized Belief Space
--------------------------------------------

Indelman, Carlone, Dellaert ISRR 2013

Summary: Beliefs are jointly over the robot state and the environment. Uses a
technique similar to expectation maximization (two loops, one using environment
estimate to plan position, one using position to estimate environment)
